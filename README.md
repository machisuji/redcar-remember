# Redcar::Remember

Saves state for a Redcar project when it is closed and restores this state when the project is opened again.

At the moment this merely includes:
* window bounds

The following might be added though:
* project tree width
* opened files

## Installation

    cd ~/.redcar/plugins
    git clone git://github.com/machisuji/redcar-remember.git remember
